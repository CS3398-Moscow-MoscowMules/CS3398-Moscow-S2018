# Moscow_Development_Progress

This branch contains all three categories used to define the GUI, the Business Logic, and the Database.  

The current project builds and runs.  The GUI is stable but is not fully implemented.  

The business logic interacts with the database and performs modifications to the data but does not yet interact with the GUI.

The database is initialized and has populated data inside of it, but still needs to grow and interact more fully with the business logic.
