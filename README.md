This branch contains all three categories used to define the GUI, the Business Logic, and the Database.

The current project builds and runs. The GUI is stable but is not fully implemented because of an Android Studio bug.

The business logic interacts with the database and performs modifications to the data and now interacts with the GUI.

The database is initialized and has populated data inside of it and fully interacts with the business logic.
